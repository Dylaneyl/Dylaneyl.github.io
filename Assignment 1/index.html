          What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
          the experience?

          When I first opened the webpage, I encountered a simple orange screen
          with artistic scribbling unfolding before my eyes. The initial thing
          that caught my attention was a prompt to enable sound by clicking on
          this screen. The sound prompt closely followed my cursor, highlighting
          the significance of audio in the experience. Additionally, the word
          'story' on the landing page indicated that I was about to start a
          visual and auditory journey unlike a typical website in which i was
          expecting.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="box3">

          Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.

      </div>
      <div id="box4">
        <p>
          Upon loading the webpage, my first action was clicking to enable
          sound. I then noticed text following my cursor, so I moved it back and
          forth across the screen while trying to read the sentences following
          my mouse. As I explored the landing page by moving my cursor around,
          the 'Sculpting Harmony' heading stretched and distorted. This prompted
          me to navigate down the webpage by scrolling. For the rest of the two
          minutes, I continued scrolling as I watched the story unfold.

        <p>
          The majority of my time was spent on the landing page, where I kept
          moving the cursor back and forth while attempting to read the
          sentences that followed my mouse. After approximately a minute of
          doing this, I realised the words were repeating and to my
          disappointment, lacked meaningful content.

        <p>
          During the brief two minute interaction I had with the website, the
          most common action was scrolling. After the introduction on the
          landing page, the story progressed smoothly as I scrolled down the
          page at my own pace. The elements of the webpage are intertwined with
          the scrolling action, and the only way to progress the experience is
          by scrolling down.

          The primary goal of this interactive experience is to depict how Frank
          Gehry and his team designed the Walt Disney concert hall in Los
          Angeles. It runs through the inspiration, drafting process, design
          choices and construction. The interactive experience also acts as a
          tourism piece encouraging people to visit the monument when in LA.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="box16">
        <p>
          The interactive experience effectively communicates its primary goal
          by providing users with small pieces of information as they navigate
          down the page. As users scroll, details about Gehry and his team's
          creation process for the Walt Disney Concert Hall are provided. The
          inclusion of glowing reviews about the venue seems to add persuasive
          element, aiming to entice users to visit the concert hall.

          The interactive website is intended as a one time experience and it took me about 5 minutes to navigate through the story. It is intended to be viewed before or after visiting the Walt Disney concert hall, as it adds perspective on the creation of the LA monument.

        <p>
          The website tells a story with a beginning and a conclusion. This conveys to the user that once they've reached the end there is no more to see. It has chapters similar to a novel, and doesn't provide users with a reason to return once they’ve experienced it for the first time. The website doesn’t have a shop or any kind of monetisation, which strengthens the theory that its only intended to be viewed once.

        <p>
          The online experience of gehry.getty.edu references several different media forms, such as orchestral performances played at the venue, news articles and opinion pieces discussing the organs built into the concert hall, as well as interviews with Frank Gehry and his team.

          These references imply that when engaging with the research experience, it's worth exploring other parts of the Walt Disney concert hall than just its architecture. There is a lot of cultural and historical significance within the venue and its important to experience those aspects of the work as they are closely related to the inspiration behind its creation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="box36">
        <p>
          When engaging with research on Disney's cultural and historical significance, the website evokes feelings of nostalgia and childhood wonder. One example of this is the use of orchestral performances of classic Disney songs, which brings the users back to how they felt watching Disney movies as a child.

        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="box37">
<p>The most frustrating aspect of the experience when interacting with it for the first time is the lack of direction I felt when navigating through the page. There were several instances when I wasn’t sure which input was appropriate to reach the next stage of the story. When the user reaches the real time model of the Walt Disney concert hall immediately after the landing page, the website expects you to scroll to progress the story, however the static satellite image presents no indication that this is the case.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="box38">
<p>The most satisfying aspect of the interactive experience is the way in which the website responds to your inputs. This is especially prevalent at the beginning of the story on the landing page where the text follows the cursor, and scrolling distorts parts of the screen. Animations like this give a real sense of gravity to each input and is satisfying to watch unfold as you navigate the page. </p>
