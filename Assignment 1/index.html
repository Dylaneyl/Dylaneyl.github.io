          What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
          the experience?

          When I first opened the webpage, I encountered a simple orange screen
          with artistic scribbling unfolding before my eyes. The initial thing
          that caught my attention was a prompt to enable sound by clicking on
          this screen. The sound prompt closely followed my cursor, highlighting
          the significance of audio in the experience. Additionally, the word
          'story' on the landing page indicated that I was about to start a
          visual and auditory journey unlike a typical website in which i was
          expecting.

      <div id="box3">
        <p>
          Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="box4">
        <p>
          Upon loading the webpage, my first action was clicking to enable
          sound. I then noticed text following my cursor, so I moved it back and
          forth across the screen while trying to read the sentences following
          my mouse. As I explored the landing page by moving my cursor around,
          the 'Sculpting Harmony' heading stretched and distorted. This prompted
          me to navigate down the webpage by scrolling. For the rest of the two
          minutes, I continued scrolling as I watched the story unfold.

          What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="box6">
        <p>
          The majority of my time was spent on the landing page, where I kept
          moving the cursor back and forth while attempting to read the
          sentences that followed my mouse. After approximately a minute of
          doing this, I realised the words were repeating and to my
          disappointment, lacked meaningful content.
