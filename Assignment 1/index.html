          What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
          the experience?

          When I first opened the webpage, I encountered a simple orange screen
          with artistic scribbling unfolding before my eyes. The initial thing
          that caught my attention was a prompt to enable sound by clicking on
          this screen. The sound prompt closely followed my cursor, highlighting
          the significance of audio in the experience. Additionally, the word
          'story' on the landing page indicated that I was about to start a
          visual and auditory journey unlike a typical website in which i was
          expecting.
