          When I first opened the webpage, I encountered a simple orange screen
          with artistic scribbling unfolding before my eyes. The initial thing
          that caught my attention was a prompt to enable sound by clicking on
          this screen. The sound prompt closely followed my cursor, highlighting
          the significance of audio in the experience. Additionally, the word
          'story' on the landing page indicated that I was about to start a
          visual and auditory journey unlike a typical website in which i was
          expecting.

          Upon loading the webpage, my first action was clicking to enable
          sound. I then noticed text following my cursor, so I moved it back and
          forth across the screen while trying to read the sentences following
          my mouse. As I explored the landing page by moving my cursor around,
          the 'Sculpting Harmony' heading stretched and distorted. This prompted
          me to navigate down the webpage by scrolling. For the rest of the two
          minutes, I continued scrolling as I watched the story unfold.

          The majority of my time was spent on the landing page, where I kept
          moving the cursor back and forth while attempting to read the
          sentences that followed my mouse. After approximately a minute of
          doing this, I realised the words were repeating and to my
          disappointment, lacked meaningful content.

        <p>
          During the brief two minute interaction I had with the website, the
          most common action was scrolling. After the introduction on the
          landing page, the story progressed smoothly as I scrolled down the
          page at my own pace. The elements of the webpage are intertwined with
          the scrolling action, and the only way to progress the experience is
          by scrolling down.

          The primary goal of this interactive experience is to depict how Frank
          Gehry and his team designed the Walt Disney concert hall in Los
          Angeles. It runs through the inspiration, drafting process, design
          choices and construction. The interactive experience also acts as a
          tourism piece encouraging people to visit the monument when in LA.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="box16">
        <p>
          The interactive experience effectively communicates its primary goal
          by providing users with small pieces of information as they navigate
          down the page. As users scroll, details about Gehry and his team's
          creation process for the Walt Disney Concert Hall are provided. The
          inclusion of glowing reviews about the venue seems to add persuasive
          element, aiming to entice users to visit the concert hall.
